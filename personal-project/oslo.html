            <p>One cannot go to Oslo without seeing three things: EVs, exquisite architecture, and people running or exercising in one way or another. Vibrant and defying architecture is all around. Current apartment complexes have revisited old construction traditions by incorporating grass rooftops in their designs. Because Norway takes its environmental goals seriously they have opted to go back to sod and turf roofs as an aid to absorb rainwater and provide insulation and habitat for wildlife. This also explains the infinite number of EVs on the streets. Who would have thought Teslas would be use as Taxis?  In regards to fitness people, that is simply their lifestyle.</p>

            <p> We stumbled upon a pizza place near our Airbnb, Ludo. Our waitress, a tall beautiful Norwegian blonde, spoke to us in our native language, Spanish, which had never happened before outside of our motherland. The pizza, which was made in a wood fire oven just in front of us was one of the best pizzas I've had, the list doesn't include the pizzas consumed in Italy surprisingly. The pizza was so delicious that I couldn't care less about the ambiance and decor of the restaurant, which are some of the aspects commensals praise the place for.</p>

        <p> From a museum with old artifacts, art, and household items used hundreds of years ago, to an impressive puzzle-like medieval wooden church, The Norwegian Museum of Cultural History has it all and more. You can find a farm, children dancing to the tune of folkloric songs, houses where actual people lived, buildings with furniture from the 50s and different decades, a quite modern cafeteria, and lovely guides dressed in folk dresses sharing interesting facts and the history of their ancestors. A day is simply not enough to enjoy all the exhibitions and attractions this place has to offer. Therapeutic in more than one way.</p>

        <p> Even if you are not a fan of Edvard Munch, visiting the museum dedicated to his craft and life will entertain you and make you appreciate his genius. There is a drawing room where you can draw and write anything you want, perfect for the little ones and, let's face it, adults as well. There is one room, my favorite exhibition, dedicated to the artist's life and struggles. One can find handwritten letters, journal entries, personal items, and even a replica of his house with the furniture he owned. He is best known for The Scream. Even though his work can look too literal, there are other pieces with more room for interpretation like the drawing, with no name, shown in the picture above, one of my personal favorites. Another therapeutic experience  that makes you more appreciate of life, love and even loss.</p>
