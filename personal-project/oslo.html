        <h1 class="title">EVs, Architecture & Fitness People</h1>
        <div class="parallax"></div>
        <p class="para">One cannot go to Oslo without seeing three things: EVs, exquisite architecture, and people
            running or
            exercising in one way or another. Vibrant and defying architecture is all around. Current apartment
            complexes have revisited old construction traditions by incorporating grass rooftops in their
            designs.
            Because Norway takes its environmental goals seriously they have opted to go back to sod and turf
            roofs
            as an aid to absorb rainwater and provide insulation and habitat for wildlife. This also explains
            the
            infinite number of EVs on the streets. Who would have thought Teslas would be use as Taxis? In
            regards
            to fitness people, that is simply their lifestyle.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Ludo</h2>
        <div class="parallax2"></div>
        <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/restaurantludo/?hl=en">Visit Ludo's Intagram!</a>
        <p class="para"> We stumbled upon a pizza place near our Airbnb, Ludo. Our waitress, a tall beautiful
            Norwegian
            blonde,
            spoke to us in our native language, Spanish, which had never happened before outside of our
            motherland.
            The pizza, which was made in a wood fire oven just in front of us was one of the best pizzas I've
            had,
            the list doesn't include the pizzas consumed in Italy surprisingly. The pizza was so delicious that
            I
            couldn't care less about the ambiance and decor of the restaurant, which are some of the aspects
            commensals praise the place for.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">The Norwegian Museum of Cultural History</h2>
        <div class="parallax3"></div>
        <a class="link" href="https://norskfolkemuseum.no/en">Visit The Norwegian Museum of Cultural History website!</a>
        <p class="para"> From a museum with old artifacts, art, and household items used hundreds of years ago, to an
            impressive
            puzzle-like medieval wooden church, The Norwegian Museum of Cultural History has it all and
            more.
            You
            can find a farm, children dancing to the tune of folkloric songs, houses where actual people
            lived,
            buildings with furniture from the 50s and different decades, a quite modern cafeteria, and
            lovely
            guides
            dressed in folk dresses sharing interesting facts and the history of their ancestors. A day is
            simply
            not enough to enjoy all the exhibitions and attractions this place has to offer. Therapeutic in
            more
            than one way.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Munch Museum</h2>
        <div class="parallax4"></div>
        <a class="link" href="https://www.munchmuseet.no/en/">Visit The Munch Museum website!</a>
        <p class="para"> Even if you are not a fan of Edvard Munch, visiting the museum dedicated to his craft and life
            will
            entertain you and make you appreciate his genius. There is a drawing room where you can draw and
            write
            anything you want, perfect for the little ones and, let's face it, adults as well. There is one
            room, my
            favorite exhibition, dedicated to the artist's life and struggles. One can find handwritten
            letters,
            journal entries, personal items, and even a replica of his house with the furniture he owned. He
            is
            best
            known for The Scream. Even though his work can look too literal, there are other pieces with
            more
            room
            for interpretation like the drawing, with no name, shown in the picture above, one of my
            personal
            favorites. Another therapeutic experience that makes you more appreciate of life, love and even
            loss.
