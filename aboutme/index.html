    <h2>Abigail Serrano</h2>
    <p> Hello there! I am Abigail. Here is a picture of me and my favorite two people in the world! My sweet husband, Lorenzo, and my beloved sister, Tamara. 
        I am the one with the striped t-shirt. I was born in Nicaragua but grew up in Costa Rica.
        My husband and I moved to the United States in 2019, a few months before the world found itself in a pandemic.</p>
    <p> Up until yesterday, I was a Business major student. Today I woke up feeling like doing something, perhaps a bit more challenging and new.
    With this class, I officially start my new journey toward completing a bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology.</p> 
    <p> I enjoy cooking, reading, and listening to music. I hope to learn to play the piano and crochet this year.</p> 
    <p> I've been married for almost seven years. Not kiddos yet, though.
        I've been working in customer service since I moved here. 
        Although it's not been bad, I would rather be doing something more fulfilling that doesn't require me to talk to people all day long.
        So, programming doesn't sound too bad. If anything, it sounds exciting and promising. So I am looking forward to learning and developing programming skills.</p>
